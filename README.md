# turtle-racing

I'm going to be making a turtle racing game where me, you, everyone will get to bet on the color of a turtle who will win the race. Then once we click 'ok' to the popup, then all of our turtles go to the starting line and they start moving at a random pace. 

And then once the first turtle hits the right edge of the screen, it will be declared the winner and we will get to see if our turtle won or not.
